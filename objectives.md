## Day 1
Spent a lot of the day running in circles. I've gotten away from pushing boundaries and getting uncomfortable. Going back to what makes development something I'm passionate about is also difficult. At work I am efficient and knowledgeable in my role. As much as I still learn, it still feels like it's within a certain scope that I don't leave too often. Independently building something from the ground up is much different than working within the confines of an assigned project.

I started the day thinking this would be a simple little program that I could knock out in a day - in a sense it still is. The idea has grown since I sat down to start.
